# Setup API Server

In order to complete the exercises and the checkpoint in this unit, you'll need to download and run a local API server.

1. Clone [https://github.com/gSchool/hypermedia-api-server](https://github.com/gSchool/hypermedia-api-server)
1. `cd` into the directory
1. Run

  ```
  yarn
  yarn start
  ```

1. Open [http://localhost:8181/api](http://localhost:8181/api)

You can see from this local server that you can get:

- Cart Items: [http://localhost:8181/api/items](http://localhost:8181/api/items)
- Products: [http://localhost:8181/api/products](http://localhost:8181/api/products)
- Products: [http://localhost:8181/api/products](http://localhost:8181/api/messages)

See the README in that repo for details.
